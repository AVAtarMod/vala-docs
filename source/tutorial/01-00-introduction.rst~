Introduction
============

Vala is an object-oriented programming language with a self-hosting compiler that generates C code and uses the GObject type system.

Vala is designed to allow access to existing C libraries, especially GObject-based libraries, without the need for runtime bindings. 

All that is needed to use a library with Vala is an API file, containing the class and method declarations in Vala syntax. 

Vala currently comes with bindings for GLib and GTK+ and many others from the GNOME Platform.

Vala can also be used to create C libraries too.

The syntax of Vala is inspired by C# and Java, so if you have used either of those, you'll seamlessly adapt to writing Vala code.

Why Vala?
---------

- Comfortably write your code in an object-oriented way with high level abstractions, while having access to deep integrations with GNOME technolgies such as: GObject, GTK and more!
- Vala compiles code down to blazingly fast, fully native binaries. You're also able to reuse existing C Code in your Vala programs as well as generate C Code from Vala.
- Vala is free and open-source software. It has a great community that contributes to the compiler and develops lots of tooling.

Who is this tutorial for?
-------------------------

This tutorial is for anybody intrested in learning Vala. This tutorial is written
with the assumption that the reader is a beginner at programming so we do make an
effort to explain programming concepts and practices throught the tutorial.

This tutorial is a series of guided programming exercies and projects that will teach you the following:

- The fundamentals of the Vala programming language.
- Basic programming concepts
- Best Practices when writing Vala programs
- A wide variety of features in the Vala programming language
- Several resources that may improve your understanding of Vala

.. note::
   We assume knowledge basic knowledge of the command line in this tutorial.

.. note::
   In this tutorial, we don't assume you are using a specific editor or IDE however, if you don't have a preferred editor we recommend using `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_ (Or `VSCodium <https://vscodium.com/>`_) with the Vala Extension for this tutorial.

.. tip::

   `Vala Language Server <https://github.com/vala-lang/vala-language-server>`_ adds Vala code intelligence and autocomplete features to any editor application that supports the `Language Server Protocol <https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/>`_.

   Feel free to add it if you prefer coding with those features enabled.

   Note: Vala Language Server is **not** required to complete this tutorial.

.. warning::
   If you see a lines in a code block that start with a ``$`` or ``>`` character, don't include them when you're copying those lines.

   They signifiy that the rest of the line is supposed to be entered in the terminal.
